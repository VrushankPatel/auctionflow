# Disaster Recovery Runbook for Auction Flow

## Overview

This runbook outlines procedures for responding to and recovering from major incidents affecting the Auction Flow platform. Auction Flow is a high-performance auction backend requiring sub-100ms bid latency and supporting 10,000 bids/second with 1 million concurrent watchers.

## RTO/RPO Targets

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for critical services (API, bidding), 24 hours for non-critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes data loss tolerance for bidding data, 1 hour for analytics data
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: 8 hours for bidding functionality

## Failure Scenarios

### 1. Single Service Failure
**Description**: Individual microservice becomes unavailable (e.g., auction-api, auction-timers, auction-notifications)

**Impact**: Partial functionality loss, potential bidding delays or notification failures

**Detection**: Monitoring alerts, health check failures, increased error rates

### 2. Database Failure
**Description**: PostgreSQL primary database becomes unavailable due to hardware failure, corruption, or overload

**Impact**: Complete system outage, inability to place bids or access auction data

**Detection**: Connection timeouts, replication lag alerts, health check failures

### 3. Cache Failure
**Description**: Redis cluster failure affecting current bid cache and watcher management

**Impact**: Increased latency for bid reads, potential stale data, degraded performance

**Detection**: Cache miss rate spikes, connection errors, performance degradation

### 4. Event Stream Failure
**Description**: Kafka cluster failure disrupting event publishing and real-time notifications

**Impact**: Delayed notifications, potential data inconsistencies, analytics pipeline disruption

**Detection**: Producer/consumer errors, topic lag alerts, event processing failures

### 5. Multi-Region Failure
**Description**: Entire region/datacenter outage affecting primary deployment

**Impact**: Complete service unavailability, potential data loss if replication fails

**Detection**: Regional health check failures, cross-region replication alerts

### 6. Security Incident
**Description**: Data breach, unauthorized access, or malicious activity

**Impact**: Data exposure, system compromise, regulatory compliance issues

**Detection**: Security monitoring alerts, anomalous access patterns, integrity check failures

### 7. Data Corruption
**Description**: Database corruption, event log inconsistencies, or application-level data errors

**Impact**: Invalid auction states, incorrect bid histories, financial discrepancies

**Detection**: Data validation job failures, reconciliation mismatches, user reports

## Recovery Procedures

### General Recovery Steps
1. Assess incident scope and impact
2. Activate incident response team
3. Communicate status per communication plan
4. Execute service-specific recovery procedures
5. Verify system integrity and data consistency
6. Gradually restore traffic
7. Conduct post-mortem

### Service Failure Recovery
1. **Identify failed service** using monitoring dashboards
2. **Check resource utilization** (CPU, memory, disk)
3. **Restart service** using deployment scripts:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/<service-name>
   # or for local development
   ./gradlew :auction-<service>:bootRun
   ```
4. **Verify health checks** pass
5. **Monitor error rates and performance** for 30 minutes
6. **Gradually increase traffic** if using load balancer

### Database Failure Recovery
1. **Confirm primary database unavailability**
2. **Promote read replica** if available:
   ```bash
   # Using existing scripts
   ./postgres_backup.sh --promote-replica
   ```
3. **If no replica available, initiate restore from backup**:
   ```bash
   ./postgres_backup.sh --restore-latest
   # or for PITR
   ./postgres_pitr_restore.sh "<timestamp>"
   ```
4. **Update connection strings** in service configurations
5. **Verify data integrity**:
   - Run reconciliation jobs
   - Check auction states and bid sequences
6. **Rebuild replicas** from promoted primary
7. **Test bidding functionality** before full traffic restoration

### Cache Failure Recovery
1. **Identify affected Redis nodes/instances**
2. **Restart Redis cluster**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart redis
   # or kubectl
   kubectl rollout restart statefulset/redis
   ```
3. **If data loss occurred, warm cache** by replaying recent events:
   - Query recent bids from database
   - Populate current highest bids
   - Rebuild watcher sets
4. **Verify cache consistency** with database
5. **Monitor cache hit rates** and performance

### Event Stream Failure Recovery
1. **Check Kafka cluster status**:
   ```bash
   kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
   ```
2. **Restart Kafka brokers** if needed
3. **Restore from backup** if data loss:
   ```bash
   ./kafka_backup.sh --restore-latest
   ```
4. **Verify topic configurations** and recreate if necessary
5. **Replay missed events** from database audit logs if required
6. **Test event publishing/consuming** across all services

### Multi-Region Failure Recovery
1. **Confirm regional outage** scope
2. **Activate secondary region** using multi-region setup scripts:
   ```bash
   ./setup-multi-region-db.sh --failover-to-secondary
   ./setup-multi-region-kafka.sh --failover-to-secondary
   ./setup-multi-region-redis.sh --failover-to-secondary
   ```
3. **Update DNS/load balancers** to route traffic to secondary region
4. **Verify data synchronization** and resolve any conflicts
5. **Monitor cross-region replication** health
6. **Plan primary region restoration** once available

### Security Incident Recovery
1. **Isolate affected systems** immediately
2. **Preserve evidence** for forensic analysis
3. **Rotate all credentials** and API keys
4. **Scan for malware/backdoors**
5. **Restore from clean backups** if compromise confirmed
6. **Notify affected users** and regulatory bodies as required
7. **Implement additional security measures**

### Data Corruption Recovery
1. **Identify corruption scope** through validation checks
2. **Quarantine corrupted data**
3. **Restore from backup** to point before corruption
4. **Use event sourcing** to replay valid events:
   - Extract clean events from Kafka backups
   - Rebuild state from event log
5. **Verify data consistency** across all tables
6. **Communicate with affected users** about any lost data
