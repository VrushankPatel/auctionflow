# Performance Budgets for Auction Flow

This document defines the acceptable latency budgets for critical operations in the Auction Flow system. These budgets ensure the system meets the nonfunctional requirements for low-latency and high performance.

## Latency Budgets

### Bid Placement
- **Operation**: POST /api/v1/auctions/{id}/bids
- **Budget**: < 10ms average response time
- **Rationale**: Bids must be processed quickly to maintain fairness and user experience during high-frequency bidding.

### Auction Creation
- **Operation**: POST /api/v1/auctions
- **Budget**: < 50ms average response time
- **Rationale**: Auction setup should be fast to allow sellers to create auctions efficiently.

### Auction Listing
- **Operation**: GET /api/v1/auctions
- **Budget**: < 100ms average response time (for paginated results)
- **Rationale**: Users need quick access to browse auctions.

### Auction Close
- **Operation**: Timer-triggered auction close
- **Budget**: < 50ms average processing time
- **Rationale**: Closing auctions promptly ensures timely winner notifications and payments.

### Timer Scheduling
- **Operation**: Scheduling auction end timers
- **Budget**: < 5ms average scheduling time
- **Rationale**: Efficient timer management is critical for handling millions of auctions.

## Monitoring and Enforcement

- JMH microbenchmarks will be run in CI to detect regressions.
- Continuous performance testing ensures budgets are met.
- Alerts will be triggered if average latencies exceed budgets by 10%.
