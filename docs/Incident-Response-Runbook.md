# Auction Flow Incident Response Runbook

## Overview

This runbook outlines procedures for detecting, responding to, and resolving incidents in the Auction Flow auction platform. The goal is to minimize impact on users and restore normal operations quickly.

## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified by severity based on impact to users and business:

- **SEV-1 (Critical)**: Complete system outage, no bids possible, potential data loss
- **SEV-2 (High)**: Significant degradation (>50% performance loss), partial functionality
- **SEV-3 (Medium)**: Minor issues, monitoring alerts, limited impact
- **SEV-4 (Low)**: Informational alerts, no user impact

## Response Process

### 1. Detection
- Monitoring alerts trigger incident creation
- User reports via support channels
- Automated health checks fail

### 2. Assessment (15 minutes)
- Gather symptoms and impact assessment
- Check monitoring dashboards (Grafana)
- Review recent deployments/changes
- Determine severity and affected components

### 3. Communication (30 minutes)
- Notify incident response team via Slack/PagerDuty
- Update status page if public-facing
- Inform stakeholders for SEV-1/2 incidents

### 4. Resolution
- Follow specific incident procedures below
- Implement temporary workarounds if needed
- Coordinate with cross-functional teams

### 5. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct blameless post-mortem within 48 hours
- Document root cause and remediation steps
- Update monitoring/alerts if needed

## Common Incident Types

### High Bid Latency (SEV-2)

**Symptoms:**
- Bid placement latency >100ms (P95)
- Users reporting slow responses
- Increased error rates

**Initial Assessment:**
```bash
# Check application metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics | grep http_request_duration

# Monitor database connections
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/db

# Check Redis performance
redis-cli --latency
```

**Response Steps:**
1. **Scale application pods** if CPU/memory high
2. **Check database slow queries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT query, total_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
3. **Verify Redis cache hit rates**
4. **Restart problematic instances** if needed
5. **Implement circuit breaker** for external services

**Escalation:** SEV-1 if latency >500ms sustained

### Database Connectivity Issues (SEV-1)

**Symptoms:**
- Connection pool exhausted errors
- Read/write timeouts
- Application startup failures

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check database health:**
   ```bash
   psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```
2. **Monitor connection counts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
   ```
3. **Restart database** if unresponsive
4. **Failover to standby** if using replication
5. **Scale connection pool** temporarily

**Recovery:** Verify data consistency post-recovery

### Redis Cache Failure (SEV-2)

**Symptoms:**
- Cache miss rates >20%
- Increased database load
- Session/authentication failures

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check Redis connectivity:**
   ```bash
   redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT ping
   ```
2. **Monitor memory usage:**
   ```bash
   redis-cli info memory
   ```
3. **Restart Redis instance**
4. **Failover to replica** if cluster configured
5. **Implement cache warming** after recovery

### Kafka Event Streaming Issues (SEV-2)

**Symptoms:**
- Consumer lag increasing
- Event processing delays
- Notifications not sent

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check broker health:**
   ```bash
   kafka-broker-api-versions --bootstrap-server $KAFKA_SERVERS
   ```
2. **Monitor consumer groups:**
   ```bash
   kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server $KAFKA_SERVERS --list
   ```
3. **Restart consumer applications**
4. **Rebalance partitions** if needed
5. **Scale consumer instances**

### Timer Service Failures (SEV-1)

**Symptoms:**
- Auctions not closing on time
- Anti-sniping not working
- Scheduled jobs not executing

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check timer metrics:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics | grep timer
   ```
2. **Verify scheduled jobs in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM scheduled_jobs WHERE status = 'PENDING';
   ```
3. **Restart timer service**
4. **Reconcile missed timers** manually if needed
5. **Verify clock synchronization**

### Security Incidents (SEV-1)

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data breaches or leaks
- Suspicious login patterns
- Failed authentication spikes

**Response Steps:**
1. **Isolate affected systems** - disconnect compromised services
2. **Preserve evidence** - take forensic snapshots, logs
3. **Notify security team** - involve legal/compliance if breach suspected
4. **Reset credentials** - force password changes for affected users
5. **Monitor for further activity** - increase logging and alerting
6. **Communicate with users** - if data exposed, notify per regulations

**Escalation:** Immediate involvement of CISO and legal team

### Payment Processing Failures (SEV-2)

**Symptoms:**
- Payment webhook failures
- Escrow not initiated
- User payment errors

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check payment provider status**
2. **Review webhook logs**
3. **Retry failed payments** manually
4. **Contact payment provider** for API issues
5. **Implement payment queue** for retries

### WebSocket Connection Issues (SEV-3)

**Symptoms:**
- Real-time notifications failing
- WebSocket connection drops
- Load balancer issues

**Response Steps:**
1. **Check WebSocket endpoints:**
   ```bash
   curl -I -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
        http://localhost:8080/ws
   ```
2. **Monitor connection counts**
3. **Restart broadcaster service**
4. **Update load balancer configuration**
