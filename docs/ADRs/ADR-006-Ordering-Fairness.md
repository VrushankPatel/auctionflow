# ADR-006: Implement FCFS Ordering with Sequence Numbers

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Auction systems must ensure fair bid ordering to maintain user trust. High-frequency trading scenarios can result in simultaneous bids that need deterministic resolution. The system must handle race conditions while maintaining low latency.

## Decision
We will implement First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) ordering:
- **Server Timestamps**: UTC millisecond precision on bid receipt
- **Sequence Numbers**: Monotonic sequence per service instance
- **Tie Breaking**: Sequence number resolves same-timestamp conflicts
- **Transactional Updates**: Compare-and-swap in database transactions

Bid processing flow:
1. Assign server timestamp and sequence number
2. Insert bid record
3. Attempt to update highest bid with conditional logic
4. Return acceptance/rejection with sequence info

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Fairness**: Deterministic ordering based on receipt time
- **Simplicity**: Clear and defensible ordering policy
- **Transparency**: Clients receive sequence information
- **Auditability**: Complete bid history with timestamps

### Negative
- **Clock Synchronization**: Requires NTP for accurate timestamps
- **Network Latency**: Client-side latency affects perceived fairness
- **Sequence Management**: Distributed sequence generation complexity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Simultaneous bids require careful handling

### Mitigation
- Use NTP for clock synchronization
- Implement distributed sequence generators
- Provide sequence information in responses
- Comprehensive testing for race conditions
