# ADR-001: Adopt CQRS and Event Sourcing Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Auction Flow requires high-performance, real-time bidding with sub-100ms latency, handling thousands of concurrent bids per second while maintaining correctness, durability, and horizontal scalability. The system needs to support complex auction rules, anti-sniping, automated bidding strategies, and real-time notifications.

Traditional CRUD architectures struggle with:
- High concurrency and race conditions in bid placement
- Maintaining audit trails and event replay
- Scaling read and write operations independently
- Ensuring deterministic ordering and fairness

## Decision
We will adopt a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing architecture:

- **Commands**: Write operations (bid placement, auction creation) are handled by the REST API service, validated, and produce events
- **Events**: All state changes are captured as immutable events in Kafka for durability and replay
- **Queries**: Read operations use optimized views (Redis cache, Postgres read replicas)
- **Event Sourcing**: Auction state is reconstructed from event streams rather than stored directly

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Scalability**: Commands and queries can scale independently
- **Durability**: Event log provides complete audit trail and disaster recovery
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with strong guarantees for critical operations
- **Performance**: Optimized read paths with caching, fast write validation
- **Debugging**: Event replay enables debugging and testing scenarios

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Higher architectural complexity compared to CRUD
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand CQRS/ES patterns
- **Eventual Consistency**: Some operations may have eventual consistency tradeoffs
- **Storage**: Event log requires careful retention and compaction strategies

### Mitigation
- Start with CQRS-lite approach, evolve to full event sourcing
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring for consistency issues
- Clear documentation and training for development team
