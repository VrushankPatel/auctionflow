1) Vision and core requirements

* Build a production-grade backend (Spring Boot REST) that runs auctions reliably, fairly, and at low-latency.
* Core behaviors: create/list auctions, place bids, enforce rules (reserve, increments, buy-now), close auctions deterministically, anti-snipe extension, payments/escrow hooks, audit trail, notifications.
* Nonfunctional priorities: correctness (single source of truth), low-latency bid acceptance, determinism of ordering, durability, horizontal scale, operational observability.

2. System overview and components

* REST API service (Spring Boot) — authoritative write model for auctions and bids.
* Persistent store (Postgres primary) for authoritative state.
* Fast cache/store (Redis) for hot reads and current-highest-bid, watches, and lock tokens.
* Event stream (Kafka) for durable event log, replay, and async consumers (notifications, payments, analytics).
* Timer service (in-memory wheel timer + persistent fallback) for scheduled auction closes, anti-snipe extensions, and retries. Use a hashed/hierarchical timing wheel for million+ timers. ([netty.io][1])
* Broadcaster: Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka -> WebSocket/SSE gateway for connected clients.
* Payment microservice or webhook integration for capture/escrow after winning.
* Admin service for reference data, KYC, trust and safety.

3. Data model (core tables, minimal columns)

* users (id, email, display\_name, role, kyc\_status, created\_at)
* sellers (id, user\_id, rating, payment\_info, status)
* items (id, seller\_id, title, description, category\_id, metadata\_json, images)
* auctions (id, item\_id, type, start\_ts, end\_ts, status, reserve\_price, buy\_now\_price, increment\_strategy\_id, extension\_policy\_id, created\_at)
* bids (id, auction\_id, bidder\_id, amount, server\_ts, seq\_no, accepted\_bool) — store server receive timestamp and monotonic seq.
* watchers/watchlist (user\_id, auction\_id)
* auction\_events (id, auction\_id, type, payload\_json, ts) — append-only event log for audit.
* payments (id, auction\_id, payer\_id, amount, status, provider\_ref)
* config/reference (bid\_increments, categories, auction\_types, extension\_policies)

4. REST API surface (key endpoints)
   (Concise list — each returns JSON; auth = JWT/OAuth)

* POST /api/v1/auctions — create auction.
* PATCH /api/v1/auctions/{id} — update metadata before first bid / admin edits.
* GET /api/v1/auctions — list/filter (status, category, seller, time window).
* GET /api/v1/auctions/{id} — auction details + current\_top\_bid.
* POST /api/v1/auctions/{id}/bids — place bid. (idempotency-key optional).
* GET /api/v1/auctions/{id}/bids — historic bids (paginated).
* POST /api/v1/auctions/{id}/watch — add watcher.
* DELETE /api/v1/auctions/{id}/watch — remove watcher.
* POST /api/v1/auctions/{id}/buy-now — immediate purchase flow.
* POST /api/v1/auctions/{id}/close — admin forced close.
* POST /api/v1/users — create user.
* GET /api/v1/users/{id}/bids — user bid history.
* POST /api/v1/payments/webhook — payment provider callback.
* GET /api/v1/reference/categories, /bid-increments, /auction-types, /extension-policies.

For every write (bids, create auction, buy-now) return a small result object with server\_ts and seq\_no so clients can reconcile.

5. Timers and scheduling

* Use a hashed or hierarchical timing wheel to schedule millions of auction close events efficiently. Create one shared timer instance per service process. Use tick duration calibrated (e.g., 100ms) to balance accuracy vs overhead. ([DEV Community][2])
* Timer responsibilities:

  * Fire auction close tasks at end\_ts.
  * Apply anti-snipe extension policy if a bid arrives within extension\_window. Reschedule close accordingly. (See anti-snipe patterns.) ([auctria.com][3])
  * Retry failed notifications and payment captures with backoff.
* Persistence: write a durable scheduled-job record to DB when scheduling. On restart, reconcile DB scheduled jobs into the wheel. This avoids lost timers on node restarts.
* Idempotency: timer worker must be idempotent. Use a db transaction with state check (auction.status) before committing close.

6. Concurrency, ordering, timestamping, fairness

* Policy choice: Recommend FCFS based on server receive ordering plus a monotonic sequence (seq\_no) assigned by the API node. FCFS is simple and defensible. Research shows order policy affects fairness and latency tradeoffs. ([arXiv][4])
* Implementation:

  * On bid arrival: API node accepts request, assigns server\_ts (UTC with ms) and a globally-incremented seq\_no (per-service instance with logical shard + local monotonic counter or use a central sequencer). Insert into DB and attempt to update auction.current\_highest via conditional update (WHERE current\_amount < new\_amount AND auction.status = OPEN) within a SERIALIZABLE or REPEATABLE READ transaction or using optimistic compare-and-swap. Use a DB row-level lock / version column to avoid races.
  * If simultaneous bids same amount and same ms, seq\_no breaks tie. Persist both in bids table but only one becomes accepted top. Return explicit outcome to both clients.
  * Consider a single-writer per auction model: route writes for a given auction to a dedicated partition or leader (shard) to avoid contention. Use consistent hashing on auction\_id to pick shard.
* Timestamp guidance: server timestamps at ms precision are usually sufficient. Do not rely on client timestamps. For ultra-low-latency fairness, use a sequencer to provide strict global order. ([SSRN][5])

7. Rate limiting and abuse controls

* Two-layer rate limiting:

  * Per-account token bucket for write ops (bid placements): default 5 bids/sec with burst up to 20. Configurable per account.
  * Per-IP rate limiting for anonymous endpoints and anti-DDoS.
  * Per-auction bidding rate cap to prevent thrashing (e.g., 100 bids/sec total accepted across system).
* Additional controls:

  * Minimum bid interval per account configurable (prevent auto-snipe bot at microsecond pace).
  * CAPTCHA challenge or two-factor for accounts flagged for abuse.
  * Adaptive throttling based on current system load and auction popularity.

8. Priority and QoS

* Prioritization levers:

  * Payment-verified / KYCed bidders can get a higher soft-limit for bids per second.
  * Seller premium can enable higher visibility and lower notification latency.
  * System-level priority: critical operations (close auction) handled at highest priority in executor queues; background tasks (analytics) at low priority.
* Processing channels:

  * Use separate threadpools/queues for bidding ingestion, timer tasks, and notification sends. Keep bidding queue short and bounded for determinism.

9. Broadcaster / real-time notifications

* Architecture:

  * Produce canonical events to Kafka on all important state changes (bid\_placed, bid\_accepted, auction\_extended, auction\_closed, winner\_announced). Use these for replay and audit.
  * For low-latency fanout to connected clients use Redis Pub/Sub or a WebSocket gateway subscribed to Kafka topics. Redis for extreme low-latency small clusters; Kafka + scalable WebSocket producers for larger deployments.
* Guarantees:

  * Deliver best-effort real-time updates. Do not rely on real-time channel for authoritative state; clients must read REST for authoritative record.
  * Events should be idempotent (include event\_id) and include server\_ts and seq\_no.
* "Sold" message: publish auction\_closed + winner event. Ensure payment initiation is triggered after auction\_closed event and before broadcasting final "sold" confirmation with payment status. Use Kafka for ordered durable event pipeline.

10. Reference data and domain lists

* auction\_types: english\_open, dutch, sealed\_bid, reserve\_price, buy\_now.
* item\_categories: hierarchical taxonomy (electronics > phones).
* increment\_strategies: fixed, percentage, dynamic ladder (table-driven).
* extension\_policies: none, fixed\_window(minutes), unlimited\_extensions, max\_extensions.
* currency\_codes, shipping\_options, return\_policy\_templates.
* seller\_tiers: basic, verified, premium.
  Store those in a reference table and expose via API.

11. Security, payments, compliance

* Auth: OAuth2/JWT with scopes. Rate-limit token refresh.
* Sensitive data: use tokenized payment references only. Do not store raw card data. Integrate PCI-compliant payment provider.
* KYC and fraud: flags on user account. Block or require deposits for high-value auctions.
* Audit: append-only auction\_events with immutability guarantees for dispute resolution.

12. Durability, scaling, and operational notes

* DB: Postgres primary with partitioning/sharding by auction\_id for scale. Use read replicas for list queries. Index on auction.end\_ts, auction.status, bids(auction\_id, amount desc).
* Cache: Redis for current\_highest and watcher sets. Use optimistic fallback to DB on cache miss.
* Events: Kafka for durable stream. Consumers: broadcaster, analytics, payment bridge, reconciliation job.
* Timer scaling: timers live in the same process but scheduled jobs must be durable. For reliability, keep timers small and push critical close events into Kafka for a central processor to execute close (leader election among processors).
* Leader election: if you run multiple timer processors, use a lightweight leader election (Zookeeper/Consul/Kafka-partition leadership) per-shard.

13. Implementation plan and priorities (iteration)
    Phase 0 (MVP, 2–4 sprints)

* Implement user/seller, item, auction create/list, bids ingestion, persistence, basic highest-bid logic, REST API, tests.
* Single-instance timer that fires close events and performs DB-transactional close.
* Simple Redis cache for current bid.
  Phase 1 (scale + fairness)
* Add Kafka event stream. Add per-auction shard/leader routing. Implement seq\_no logic and idempotency. Add anti-snipe extension policy.
  Phase 2 (hardening)
* Add Redis/Kafka-based broadcaster, persisted scheduled jobs, payment integration, KYC flows, rate-limiting infra, monitoring, alerting.
   Phase 3 (scale/HA)
* Partition DB, deploy multiple timer workers with leader election per partition, disaster recovery, DDL and schema evolution plan.
   Phase 4 (AI features)
* Implement full reinforcement learning for bidding strategies, integrate ML models, add strategy analytics.

13. Automated bidding strategies

* Users can set up automated bidding strategies to bid on their behalf.
* Strategy types: sniping prevention (bid early to avoid last-minute), optimal timing (bid during low activity), budget optimization (distribute budget across auctions), reinforcement learning (adaptive bidding based on past performance).
* Strategies are evaluated after each bid placement to determine if automated bids should be placed.
* Integration with existing bid flow and event system.

14. Testing and verification checklist

* Functional unit tests for auction lifecycle and bid acceptance.
* Concurrency tests simulating simultaneous bids (generate conflicts). Verify ordering and determinism.
* Load tests: sustained bids/sec and spike tests.
* Chaos testing: node restart during timer events, lost Kafka partitions, DB failover. Ensure idempotency.
* Security tests: auth bypass, payment webhook forgery, rate-limit bypass.

15. Edge cases and deep focus areas

* Simultaneous bids and fairness. Use server-assigned seq\_no and transactional compare-and-swap. ([SSRN][5])
* Timer reliability on restarts. Persist scheduled close records. Reconcile on startup.
* Anti-sniping policy design. Choose deterministic extension policy and implement limit to prevent unbounded extension if desired. ([auctria.com][3])
* Idempotency across retries: require idempotency-keys for client retries for bid placement.
* Reconciliation: build offline job to compare event stream vs DB state for disputes.

Appendix — short sample bid flow (sequence)

1. Client POST /auctions/{id}/bids with amount.
2. API server assigns server\_ts and seq\_no. Write to bids table and attempt to update auctions.current\_highest in a single transaction. If success, produce bid\_accepted event to Kafka and update Redis. If not, produce bid\_rejected event with reason.
3. If bid within extension\_window, scheduler reschedules auction end and emits auction\_extended event.
4. On auction close, timer task marks auction CLOSED in DB, produces auction\_closed event, triggers payment capture workflow, then broadcasts winner.
